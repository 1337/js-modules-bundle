Small JavaScript files with seemingly unrelated functions.

All scripts attach to the global `$` object, whether or not it is jQuery. Enjoy!

## How to use

* Clone the entire repository, or just `pubsub.js`.
* Download any additional scripts you'd like to use.
  They are all well-documented and you will know how to use them in a jiffy.
* Include them on a page.
* Voila!

## How to contribute

More modules are welcome! Build your modules like the others, submit a pull
request, and they will be included in the repo.
